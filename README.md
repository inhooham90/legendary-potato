# Legendary Potato

**Legendary Potato** is a potato fighting game. Don't underestimate them! They know martial arts! <br/>


## Story

There can be only one legendary potato. Who will it be?


## The Game

Users can move the main characters, martial art potatoes. Two players can fight each other.

Potatoes are animated through javascript to make the game more visually appeasing.

Sprites, background, and all other pixel art works are made by me. Feel free to use them if you wish, but please mention! :)

## Development Log

**Day 1:** Think of a storyline, way to tell the story, main character design, create sample main character sprites. Set up canvas and animation rendering.



**Day 2:** Create background, TaeKwonDo Potato Sprite, implement movement/position and rendering logic, and finalize game plan. Implement animation for punches and kicks. Set up push backs, attack types and damage rate, rough draft of health point system, and minor collision logic.

**Day 3:** Jump, jump attacks, sprite work, and lots of debugging and optimization with rendering.

**Day 4:** Hp bar, vs sign, music, sprite art, and more optimization.
